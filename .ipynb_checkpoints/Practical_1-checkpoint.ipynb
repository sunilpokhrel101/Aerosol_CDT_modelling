    "# Practical 1) Creating binned size distributions and calculating PM2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first practical, we are going to practice creating discrete size distributions before then calculaing the total mass loading for a range of ambient environments. Creating a size distribution can often feel like an ardous task and is a useful exercise in translating equations to code. This will also serve as a useful warm-up exercise for deploying a range of Python functions. You will have looked at Python as part of your training already; However learning to code wholst focusing on a domain relevant problem is often the best way to learn. With that in mind, today's first practical is comprised of 4 exercises across 3 main objectives.\n",

As noted by [Jacobson 2005]() fifty percent of the area under a lognormal distribution lies below the geometric-mean diameter.  and 68 percent of the area under the lognormal distribution lies within one geometric standard deviation of the geometric-mean diameter.\n",

The third, whilst still used in large scale schemes and often called the modal approach, has limitations when we come to tracking invidual components. The second is the most popular and is known as the setional approach. This approach requires us to split the continuous size distribution into discrete size bins. We have used the log-normal approach above and will continue to do so. Limiting the number of bins in a model is often the easiest method of reducing computer-time and memory limits. We will discuss this in class. For now we need to cover all particle sizes with a fixed number of bins; The bins should be spread geometrically and we can thus look at a geomteric distribution known as the volume-ratio distribution. In this distribution, a fixed volume ratio between bins defines the centre of the bin and bin width. We will see in this exercise that we can also simply choose linearly seperated values in log diameter space.
